Integrated pest management\\n2.1 What is IPM?\\nFor each pest and disease covered in this manual, methods are first given for prevention of the problem. Then, if \\nintervention is needed when a pest or disease occurs, the safest and most effective options available are listed. \\nThe approach used in the manual is called Integrated Pest Management (IPM).\\nIPM consists of 4 main steps:\\n 1.  Identification: The section on Key Signs is designed to help identify the pest or disease.\\n  2.  Prevention: This includes cultural approaches, such as use of disease resistant varieties, disease-free seed and \\nadoption of good practices in the field, such as removal of infected material that could carry the problem over to \\nthe next crop. It also includes use of pesticides where this method is appropriate.'),\n",

Control: This includes both cultural approaches, such as removal of infected plants, as well as use of appropriate \\npesticides.\\nIPM often involves the combination of several different options. Pesticides tend to be used when other approaches are \\ninadequate for the problem at hand; they must always be used in accordance with the usage and safety information \\ngiven on the pack.\\n2.2 Monitoring crops for pests and diseases\\nWith most pests and diseases, the earlier the problem is noticed the better: it will be easier to take action to \\nhelp prevent severe losses occurring or stop the pest or disease spreading throughout the crop and beyond to \\nneighbouring fields.'),\n",

Do not use \\nsuckers from banana plants affected by BXW, even if the suckers appear healthy.\\nRemoval of the male bud by hand or with a forked stick (to reduce the risk of moving bacteria on cutting tools) will limit the risk \\nof infection via pollen and nectar feeding insects that have previously fed on infected plants. Timing of removal is important; \\nmale buds need to be cut off quickly after the fruit has been set. The drawbacks are that the method is time-consuming and \\nsome farmers believe the male bud is essential for good juice production in beer types of banana.\\nChemical approaches: Cutting tools can be cleaned with household bleach (one part to four parts of water), solutions'),\n",
